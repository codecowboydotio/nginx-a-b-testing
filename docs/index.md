# A/B Testing using F5 DeviceID and NGINX+

I recently figured out how to use F5's DeviceID service with NGINX+ to perform A/B testing.
This is not only a cool and geeky thing to do, but I figured out it's very very useful.
Along the way, I also wrote a crude control panel page to let me change the split without resorting to curl :)
